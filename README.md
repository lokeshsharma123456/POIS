# Cryptographic Algorithms README

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is designed to perform specific cryptographic tasks, ensuring data security and integrity.
Algorithms Included

    **CBC_MAC** (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code)
        Description: CBC_MAC is a message authentication code that uses a block cipher in CBC mode to provide integrity and authenticity.

    **CCA** (Chosen Ciphertext Attack)
        Description: CCA is a type of attack on cryptosystems where an attacker can choose ciphertexts and obtain the corresponding plaintexts.

    **CPA** (Chosen Plaintext Attack)
        Description: CPA is a type of attack on cryptosystems where an attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts.

    **EAV (Eavesdropping)** Description: EAV refers to the practice of secretly listening to or monitoring private conversations or communications without the knowledge or consent of the parties involved. It is typically used in the context of surveillance or unauthorized data interception.

    **MAC (Message Authentication Code)**
        Description: MAC is a cryptographic technique used to provide message integrity and authenticity using a secret key.

    **PRF (Pseudorandom Function)**
        Description: PRF is a function used in cryptography to generate pseudorandom output that appears random to an observer without knowledge of the function's input.

    **PRG (Pseudorandom Generator)**
        Description: PRG is an algorithm used to generate a sequence of pseudorandom bits or numbers from an initial seed or key.
